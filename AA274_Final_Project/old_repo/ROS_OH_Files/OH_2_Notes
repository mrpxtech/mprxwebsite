Assuming all instructions are followed to setup the necessary files from HW2 P0.

Everytime a new terminal is opened in Ubuntu on a personal computer, 
rostb3 must be ran in order to set the ros instance to be created on a personal computer to redirect to the ros instance on the turtlebot. 
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<turtlebot_name>.local:11311
export ROS_IP=$(ifconfig <network_interface> | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}')
export ROS_HOSTNAME=$(ifconfig <network_interface> | grep 'inet addr:' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}')

type ifconfig in vm terminal to get the <network_interface>

After running rostb3, enable bridge networking.  

Then ssh AA274@<namerobot>.local

Then, personal computer can be used to send ros commands to the turtlebot without having to ssh into the turtlebot and accessing 
the robot ros instance via terminal.

The ros commands are sent as usual to the turtlebot, with the idea that all of the scripts to be ran are on the personal computer.  
The big takeaway from the OH session was the use of the publisher/subscriber to send and 
receive commands for where to move the robot (pose_controller.py example).
