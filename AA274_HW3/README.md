#### Submission
For the code portion, you will just submit `ekf.py` to gradescope. Make sure that you submit the most up-to-date one.
Don't forget to also submit your written portion as well.


<!-- ### Submission Instructions

#### Submission
The submission script will look for `ekf.py`, `ExtractLines.py`, and `maze_sim_parameters.py` in your catkin workspace (i.e., at `~/catkin_ws/src/asl_turtlebot/scripts`) instead of this directory as we suspect that's where your most updated versions of those files are located. Please ensure that this is the case.

Please place your `localization.bag` and `map_fixing.bag` in the directory from which you are running the submission script (i.e., this directory `.../AA274_HW3/`).

Though there was no explicit written component to this problem set, if you have a `<your-sunet-id>.pdf` you'd like to submit along with your code you may place it in the base level of this directory (i.e., at `.../AA274_HW3/pavone.pdf`).

To download the submission script, open this directory (i.e., `.../AA274_HW3/`) in your terminal and run `git pull` at the command line. Then:

Run `./submit_hw3.sh` and follow the instructions to submit! -->
